# like-system

I have created two buttons Like and Unlike in details page. When User 1 click Like Button of the product and the button changed into Unlike button. The data is updated in database showing likes table in User ID and Product ID. But when the User 2 click Like button, the user id in likes table is same id of the first user. I need different user id while clicking like of the same product. Can you help me out with this? I would be appreciate.
